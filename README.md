# The Stack Clone

Simple project using Three.js and GSAP 3.

You can play it [here](https://stackclone-bfbc3.web.app).

Song was made using [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com). Available to download inside stack-clone/sound

NOTE: For dependencies, you only need [gsap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gsap) and [three](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three) for the core game. The others are just for building/hosting.

## Installation

You will need node, npm, and yarn.

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/Goggwell/stack-clone.git

# Move to folder, install dependencies, and start local server
cd stack-clone
yarn install
yarn start
```

You will need to visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to play the game.

NOTE FOR VSCODE USERS: Running ```yarn run build``` and then using the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension also works.
